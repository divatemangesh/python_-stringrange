# python_-stringrange

In the python range function you can get list of integers just typing 
range(1,10)
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10]
but what if we want range of character from 'a' to 'z'
range('a','z')
range() integer end argument expected, got str.
we will get error 
so in order to solve this problem we can add this module to python then we will be able to get range of chracters(strings) 

This repository is  a module to add functionality to string range function
The code in this repo is not a perfect code for python repo
